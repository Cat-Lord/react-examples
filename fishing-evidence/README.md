# Frontend Application for Fishing Evidence
Java Backend provides local server that we'll be using to connect to and communicate with. This application will

## Technical details
- React created with create-react-app
- Typescript: Type safety. Suffer in the name of easy debugging !
- Tailwind css (first time, checking it out): Nice styling
- Axios: Communication with backend
